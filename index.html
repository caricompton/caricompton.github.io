        Beyond rumors, there have been numerous stories of high schoolers and college students posting far more serious content, posing harm to their schools and universities. The challenge lies in distinguishing between what constitutes a genuine threat and what is merely a joke. <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cmfqx4qWxE"> How can we determine the difference?</a></p>

          <h2>What it's Like to Work in a Courthouse</h2>
          <p class="description">I began my internship at the Montgomery County Courthouse in April, and this experience has been an invaluable learning opportunity for me, providing insights into the legal system and its operations. The program I am involved in emphasizes the critical role of advocates for both victims and witnesses in court cases. In my blog post, I aim to explore the public's fascination with serial killers. This interest, as I have witnessed firsthand, can have significant and often detrimental effects on the lives of victims' families and friends.

          <h2>What is the Victim/Witness Assistance Program?</h2>
          <p class="description">The Victim/Witness Assistance Program is often unheard of until one becomes a victim of a crime. However, it's crucial to know that victims and witnesses are not alone; they have an entire support network dedicated to helping them navigate the complexities of the criminal justice process. <a href="https://montva.com/commonwealth's-attorney/victim-witness-program"> Our top priority: </a> advocating for victims' rights and ensuring they have a voice in their pursuit of justice. The first question we ask victims is, "What is their input on the case? So, what rights do victims of crime possess, and <a href="https://victimsofcrime.org/"> what resources are available </a> to them? <a href="https://secure.givelively.org/donate/national-center-for-victims-of-crime-inc"> Will you join us in making a positive impact?</a></p>
