        Beyond rumors, there have been numerous stories of high schoolers and college students posting far more serious content, posing harm to their schools and universities. The challenge lies in distinguishing between what constitutes a genuine threat and what is merely a joke. <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cmfqx4qWxE"> How can we determine the difference?</a></p>

          <h2>Unmasking the Obsession: Decoding the Media's Serial Killer Fixation</h2>
          <p class="description">I began my internship at the Montgomery County Courthouse in April, and this experience has been an invaluable learning opportunity for me, providing insights into the legal system and its operations. The program I am involved in emphasizes the critical role of advocates for both victims and witnesses in court cases. In my blog post, I aim to explore the public's fascination with serial killers. This interest, as I have witnessed firsthand, can have significant and often detrimental effects on the lives of victims' families and friends.

          <h2>What is the Victim-Witness Assistance Program?</h2>
          <p class="description">The Victim-Witness Assistance Program is often unheard of until one becomes a victim of a crime. However, it's vital to recognize that victims and witnesses have a dedicated support network to help them navigate the complexities of the criminal justice process. There are three Victim-Witness Coordinators, two for General District Court and one for Juvenile and Domestic Court. <a href="https://montva.com/commonwealth's-attorney/victim-witness-program"> Our primary focus</a> is advocating for victims' rights and ensuring they have a voice in their pursuit of justice. When engaging with victims, our initial inquiry is, "What input do they have on the case?" So, what rights do crime victims possess, and what <a href="https://victimsofcrime.org/">resources</a> are available to them? <a href="https://secure.givelively.org/donate/national-center-for-victims-of-crime-inc"> Will you join us</a> in making a positive impact?</p>

            At the courthouse, my role as an intern encompasses a diverse array of hands-on responsibilities. I am actively engaged in direct interactions with victims involved in criminal cases, collaborating closely with prosecutors, and occasionally engaging in discussions with defense attorneys. Additionally, I assist petitioners with protective orders and attend disposition, preliminary, arraignment, protective order, and bond hearings in both General District Court and, at times, Circuit Court. My role extends beyond these aspects, and for a more comprehensive explanation, I invite you to watch my <a href="https://youtu.be/0NAcPHasy7o?si=xS_3Rr6jdauDD_V1" > video</a> where I delve into the details of my experiences. </p>

            The Commonwealth's Attorney is responsible for prosecuting felonies, specific misdemeanors, and traffic offenses. Within this office, the Victim Assistance Program is established to provide support to prosecutors handling cases with victims and witnesses. Our primary role includes reaching out to and assisting victims, and then relaying crucial information to the prosecutors. The office is staffed with one <a href="https://montva.com/commonwealth's-attorney/about-the-commonwealth-s-attorney">Commonwealth Attorney</a>, a Chief Deputy, and six Assistant Commonwealth Attorneys. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8ji3pVYrGs&t=94s">This video </a> showcases one of our courtrooms, featuring our Commonwealth Attorney and Chief Deputy handling an actual criminal case. The victim involved in this particular case is a juvenile,  and seated within the gallery is our Victim-Witness Coordinator for Juvenile and Domestic Court.</p>
